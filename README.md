The Concord University Child Development Center is a daycare that still communicates, and records information on old fashion pen and paper. 
The CUCDC tracker is a website that will allow teachers and parents to have fasted access to the following:
  Meals:
       - to see what meals their child was given (Breakfast, Lunch, Snack)
       - food allergies 
       - how much the child either ate or did not eat
  Diaper Changes: (mostly ages infant - toddlers)
       - Teachers can log when the child has been changed.
       - Request need for more diapers, wipes, ointment
       - If a child has an accident they can log the information for the parent to be aware. 
       - Request a new pair of extra clothing if the child is out
  Communication:
       - Find the teacher, director contact information to reach out if needed
       - Teachers and directors can have access to the child's parents' information for emergencies.
